# Shared Rules

Cross-cutting hard rules for all tools. Each tool file references this document instead of inlining these rules.

## Version Update Priority (Hard Rule)

Version update pre-check is owned by `upgrade` and serves as the highest-priority gate.

- When "update version / plugin issue / version uncertainty / compatibility problem" is mentioned, route to `upgrade` for version confirmation first.
- Before running `init` or `doctor`, if version status is unknown, complete `upgrade` version check first.
- After `init` completes, a `doctor` run is mandatory.
- When `upgrade` finds the version is already current, it does not enter migration; it only asks the user whether to continue with a `doctor` self-check.
- Default flow: `upgrade` (version check) → (optional) `doctor` → `self-improve`.
- `doctor` is not a prerequisite gate for `upgrade`.

## Confirm Before Executing (Hard Rule)

When the user has not explicitly issued a tool command, confirm with a one-line question before executing. Never auto-run based on a candidate intent.

- Loop Phase 2 context summary must receive user confirmation before entering Phase 3.
- Self-Improve may write directly when explicitly triggered or pipeline-triggered, without additional confirmation.
- Write operations follow each tool file's own rules; no additional global "draft-then-write" gate is imposed.

## Semantic Link Rules (Hard Rule)

Three link relationship types: `based-on` / `led-to` / `related`.

Association strength requirements:
- `decision`: **at least one valid `[[...]]` link is required**
- `pipeline`: **at least one valid `[[...]]` link is required**
- `knowledge`: links recommended (may be empty)
- `maxim`: source links recommended (may be empty)

Loop output that becomes a `decision` or `pipeline` must have its links filled in before wrap-up.

## Data Boundaries

- **System capability** (updated via plugin): `<SYSTEM_SKILL_ROOT>/` (inside `skills/pensieve/`, plugin-managed)
  - Contains tools / scripts / system knowledge / format READMEs
  - Does not include built-in pipelines / maxims content
- **User data** (project-level, not overwritten by default): `<USER_DATA_ROOT>/` (`<project>/.claude/skills/pensieve/`)
  - Sole exception: `upgrade` may back up then overwrite critical files (`run-when-*.md`, `knowledge/taste-review/content.md`) for content alignment.
  - Full directory structure in `<SYSTEM_SKILL_ROOT>/references/directory-layout.md`

Path conventions (injected by SessionStart hook):
- `<SYSTEM_SKILL_ROOT>` = absolute path to `skills/pensieve/` inside the plugin
- `<USER_DATA_ROOT>` = absolute path to project-level `.claude/skills/pensieve/`

## Spec-First (Read Before Write)

Before creating or checking any type of user data, read the corresponding format spec README:

1. `<SYSTEM_SKILL_ROOT>/maxims/README.md`
2. `<SYSTEM_SKILL_ROOT>/decisions/README.md`
3. `<SYSTEM_SKILL_ROOT>/pipelines/README.md`
4. `<SYSTEM_SKILL_ROOT>/knowledge/README.md`

Constraints:
- Items not explicitly marked `must / required / hard rule / at least one` in the spec must not be flagged as MUST_FIX.
- Limited inference from the spec is allowed but must be labeled as "inferred item".

## Confidence Gate (Pipeline Output Quality)

Each candidate issue in pipeline output must be tagged with a confidence score (0-100):

| Range | Handling |
|-------|----------|
| >= 80 | Included in final report |
| 50-79 | Labeled "pending verification", not presented as a definitive conclusion |
| < 50 | Discarded |

Only issues with confidence >= 80 are reported as definitive conclusions.
