# Maxims Index

This file is the project-level maxim index.

## Priority Order

1. [[eliminate-special-cases-by-redesigning-data-flow]]
2. [[preserve-user-visible-behavior-as-a-hard-rule]]
3. [[prefer-pragmatic-solutions-over-theoretical-completeness]]
4. [[reduce-complexity-before-adding-branches]]

## How to Use

- Keep one maxim per file under `.claude/pensieve/maxims/`.
- Use one-sentence conclusion titles.
- Keep this index ordered by priority (top = strongest).
- When maxims conflict, follow earlier items first.

## Notes

- Add new maxims sparingly.
- Prefer refining existing maxims before creating new ones.
