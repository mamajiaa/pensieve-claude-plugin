# Prefer pragmatic solutions over theoretical completeness

## One-line Conclusion
> Solve the real problem now with the simplest reliable design.

## Quote
"I'm a damn pragmatist."

## Guidance
- Optimize for working systems and maintenance cost, not abstract elegance.
- Expose invalid inputs early instead of hiding them with fallback layers.
- Avoid speculative abstractions without clear near-term value.

## Boundaries
- Do not use pragmatism as an excuse to skip critical quality checks.
