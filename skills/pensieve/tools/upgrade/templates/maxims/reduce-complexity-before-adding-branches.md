# Reduce complexity before adding branches

## One-line Conclusion
> When logic grows hard to read, simplify structure first and branch later only if necessary.

## Quote
"If you need more than 3 levels of indentation, you're screwed anyway; fix your program."

## Guidance
- Split large functions by responsibility.
- Keep control flow shallow and explicit.
- Prefer clear naming over explanatory comments.

## Boundaries
- Small, local branches are acceptable when they improve clarity.
