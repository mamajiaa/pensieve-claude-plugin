# Preserve user-visible behavior as a hard rule

## One-line Conclusion
> Any unexpected user-visible behavior change is treated as a bug.

## Quote
"We do not break user-visible behavior."

## Guidance
- Keep outputs, contracts, and UX stable unless change is explicitly approved.
- Treat behavior regressions as priority defects.
- Add tests for behavior that users already rely on.

## Boundaries
- Explicitly approved behavior changes are allowed when documented and reviewed.
