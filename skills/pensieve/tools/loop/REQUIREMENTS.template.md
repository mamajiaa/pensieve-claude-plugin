## Writing Rules

- Create at `.claude/pensieve/loop/{date}-{slug}/requirements.md`
- Write a first draft before asking questions
- After user confirmation, record the path in `_context.md`

## Key Conversation

### Requirements Clarification (2026-01-23)

User: "I want multiple terminals to share state."

Follow‑ups:
Q: What scenario do you expect?
A: I started a task in terminal A and want to continue in terminal B.

Q: Do you need two terminals running different tasks at the same time?
A: No, only one at a time.

Q: What is the desired outcome?
A: Open a new terminal and continue where I left off.

Clarified experience:
- Start a loop in terminal A
- Close terminal A, continue in terminal B
- Progress is preserved from last stop
```

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Response |
|---------|----------|
| Requirements too vague | Success criteria must be verifiable |
| Unclear boundaries | "Out of scope" must be explicit |
| Forgot to update | Update the anchor when requirements change |
| Writing a PRD | This is an anchor, not a full doc — keep it short |
